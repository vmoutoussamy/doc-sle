"Security is about decisions, and whenever security is in (apparent) "
"opposition to function, these decisions become trade-offs. While it can be "
"argued that all systems should be set up to be as securely as possible, some "
"levels of security and hardening may very well be overkill in some cases. "
"Each system's operational environment has its own security requirements "
"derived from business drivers or regulatory compliance mandates. &sls; can, "
"for example, be configured to comply with security standards, such as SOX, "
"HIPAA and PCIDSS. It can also be set up to fulfill the requirements from the "
"German Federal Office of Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in "

"there is a contradiction to security, an informed discussion in the "
