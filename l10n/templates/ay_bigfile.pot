"A standard Linux installation asks many questions about what to install, "

"Answering these questions once is informative and maybe even fun. But "
"imagine a system engineer who needs to set up a new Linux network with many "
"machines. Now, the same issues need to be addressed and the same questions "
"answered repeatedly. This makes the task very inefficient, not to mention a "

"The thought of simply copying the hard disks naturally crosses one's mind. "
"This can be done quickly, and all the necessary functions and software will "
"be copied without option selection. However, the fact is that simple copying "
"of hard disks causes the individual computers to become too similar. This, "
"in turn, creates an altogether new mission of having to reconfigure the "
"individual settings on each PC. For example, IP addresses for each machine "
"will need to be reset. If this is not done properly, strange and "
